## PLAYING

## EDITING CODE

- There is a line in class "Game" --> function "path" you need to comment out/in (remove comment when converted to an exe and comment when run in editor)

```(hier noch die Zeilennummer angeben, wenn fertig) parentDirectory = os.path.join(parentDirectory, "game")

```

- remember to install a package to convert the script into an exe (for example [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/))
